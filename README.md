## Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Cisco Intersight Service for HashiCorp Terraform (IST) addresses the challenge of securely connecting and configuring on-premises and hybrid environments to work with Terraform Cloud Business Tier.
Leveraging Intersight Assist, users can integrate Terraform Cloud Business with Cisco Intersight, enabling secure communication between on-premises data centers and edge locations with the IaC platform. This means users can spend less time managing the end-to-end lifecycle of Terraform Cloud Agents, benefiting from native integration directly within Intersight, including upgrades and the ability to scale as demand grows.

In this example, we cover a how we can use IST to automatically configure Cisco ACI.

We will automate configuration of ACIâ€™s logical constructs i.e. Tenant, Bridge domain, AP, EPG, Contracts, Filters to build a 3 tier application in ACI.

1. Intersight SaaS platform account with Advantage licenses
2. An Intersight Assist appliance that is connected to your Intersight environment.
